- 👋 Hi, I’m @RezaHoque
- 👀 I’m a software developer and write code for living. My skills are mostly on Sitecore, c#/.Net, Web API but not limited to those only.
- 🌱 I’m very much enthusiasts on Python/Django, DevOp tech like Docker, Terraform and AI. I try to explore those on my free time.
- 💞️ I am a husband and father of two. I love taking photographs.
